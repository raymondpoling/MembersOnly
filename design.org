The Gym Manager would like you to create a new application to manage Gym
Membership(Gold, Platinum & Regular).

Create an application with multiple activities using the MVP architecture - one
activity for simply viewing all the current members and the other activity to
add members. The Gym Manager should be able to delete members from the
application as well.

As a security measure - please create a Login activity which uses
EncryptedSharedPreferences to store a username and password - the GymManager
should be able to change the username and password once they login.

So the application will consist of 4 activities ->
1. LoginActivity
2. GymMembersActivity
3. AddMemberActivity
4. ChangePasswordActivity
