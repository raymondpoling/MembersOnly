# MembersOnly
Gym membership app

The Gym Manager would like you to create a new application to manage Gym Membership(Gold, Platinum & Regular).

Create an application with multiple activities using the MVP architecture - one activity for simply viewing all the current members and the other activity to add members. The Gym Manager should be able to delete members from the application as well.

As a security measure - please create a Login activity which uses EncryptedSharedPreferences to store a username and password - the GymManager should be able to change the username and password once they login.

So the application will consist of 4 activities ->

1. LoginActivity
2. GymMembersActivity
3. AddMemberActivity
4. ChangePasswordActivity
